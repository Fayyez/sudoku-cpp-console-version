# sudoku-cpp-console-version
As the name suggests, this is a console version of sudoku game coded in C++ which I made as my semester project in the course of pf. Just like the classic Sudoku, the objective here is to fill a 9 Ã— 9 grid with digits so that each column, each row, and each of the nine 3X3 subgrids that compose the main board contain all of the digits from 1 to 9.

*REMEMBER!!* no digit can be repeated in any row, column or subgrid ;)

## Features

- Supports input validation to ensure puzzle rules are followed.
- Save game in upto 3 slots.
- Get solution if you get stuck anywhere
- A leaderboard with top 7 players and their scores of all time
