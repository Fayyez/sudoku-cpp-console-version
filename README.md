# sudoku-cpp-console-version
As the name suggests, this is a console version of sudoku game coded in C++ which I made as my semester project in the course of pf. Just like the classic Sudoku, the objective here is to fill a 9 Ã— 9 grid with digits so that each column, each row, and each of the nine 3X3 subgrids that compose the main board contain all of the digits from 1 to 9.

*REMEMBER!!* no digit can be repeated in anyrow, column or subgrid ;)

## Features

- Interactive console interface for playing Sudoku puzzles.
- Supports input validation to ensure puzzle rules are followed.
- Displays the puzzle board with easy-to-read formatting.
  
## Prerequisites

To compile and run the Sudoku C++ console version, you'll need the following:

- C++ compiler (e.g., GCC, Clang)

*Or you can simply download and run the `main.exe` file (x64 bit) ðŸ˜‰*
